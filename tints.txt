I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
I'm tryna get some fresh air
Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off
You know it never rains here
And you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ain't gotta drown or waste your potential
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dying for less here
I been in my bag anyway
Tryna throw a bag in the safe
Gig on tour, ensurin' my bass
Wavin' my lil' ones and bathing apes
Niggas dying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rearview mirror
I can't be ridin', ridin', round that open street
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
You probably think a nigga trollin'
Or showin' out for the cameras
Fuck, I'm doin' fish-bowlin'
One hunnid thou on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in his image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hunnid horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'cause bomb is head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) so I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines
So fuck a fix it ticket, you pull me over and might see
One of your bitches
Ridin', ridin', round that open street
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
You know I like it presidential
Stretch it out, that's a limo
Pull it over, let me get behind ya
Where we goin' they don't need to know
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom
Niggas never see me comin'
She wanna hold me like a ransom
But the money keep me runnin'
I been in my bag anyway
Tryna throw a bag in the safe
Gig on tour, ensurin' my bass
Wavin' my lil' ones and bathing apes
Niggas cryin' for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rearview mirror
Ridin', ridin', round that open street
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (windows tinted) I need tints
(I need my windows tinted)
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming no, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming
